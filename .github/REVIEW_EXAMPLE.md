## 🔍 Key Review Areas

### 🔒 Security Issues

**🟡 Warning - API Credentials Exposure**
- **Location**: `backend/scrapers/spotify-search.ts:12-13`
- **Issue**: Spotify client ID and secret are hardcoded in the source file
- **Why**: These credentials could be exposed if the code is committed to a public repository
- **Fix**: Move to environment variables
  ```typescript
  // Current code
  const clientId = 'abc123def456';
  const clientSecret = 'xyz789';

  // Suggested fix
  const clientId = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID;
  const clientSecret = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET;

  if (!clientId || !clientSecret) {
    throw new Error('Spotify credentials not configured');
  }
  ```

**Rating**: Warning 🟡 (No critical security issues, but credentials should be in .env)

---

### ⚡ Performance Concerns

**🔵 Suggestion - Debounce Search Input**
- **Location**: `apps/web/public/index.html:450-455`
- **Issue**: Search triggers API call on every keystroke
- **Impact**: Excessive API calls, poor user experience with many requests
- **Fix**: Add debouncing with 300ms delay
  ```javascript
  let searchTimeout;
  searchInput.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
    clearTimeout(searchTimeout);
    searchTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
      performSearch(e.target.value);
    }, 300);
  });
  ```

**🔵 Suggestion - Cache Search Results**
- **Location**: `backend/scrapers/spotify-search.ts:45`
- **Issue**: Same searches hit API every time
- **Impact**: Unnecessary API calls and slower response
- **Fix**: Implement simple in-memory cache with expiration

**Rating**: Minor concerns 🟡 (Would benefit from optimizations)

---

### 🐛 Potential Bugs

**🟡 Warning - Missing Null Check on YouTube Search**
- **Location**: `backend/scrapers/spotify-search.ts:78`
- **Issue**: YouTube search result may return null if video not found
- **Why**: Will cause error when trying to access `.videoId` property
- **Fix**:
  ```typescript
  const youtubeResult = await searchYouTube(song.name, song.artist);
  if (!youtubeResult || !youtubeResult.videoId) {
    console.warn(`No video found for ${song.name}`);
    continue; // Skip this song
  }
  ```

**🔵 Suggestion - Handle Empty Playlist**
- **Location**: `apps/web/public/index.html:500`
- **Issue**: No UI feedback if user's playlist is empty
- **Impact**: Blank modal confuses users
- **Fix**: Show message "No songs found. Try a different playlist."

**Rating**: Some edge cases need handling 🟡

---

### 📐 Code Quality

**Overall**: Good code organization with clear function names and logical flow.

**Positives**:
- ✅ Functions are small and focused
- ✅ Variable names are descriptive
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly
- ✅ Code follows project conventions

**Suggestions**:
- 🔵 Consider extracting modal HTML to separate template file
- 🔵 Add JSDoc comments to exported functions
- 🔵 Use constants for magic numbers (e.g., `MAX_RESULTS = 50`)

**Rating**: Good 👍

---

### 🧪 Testing

**Current state**:
- ❌ No automated tests included for Spotify integration
- ❌ No tests for YouTube search fallback
- ❌ No tests for error handling paths

**Impact**: Medium risk - feature works but harder to maintain

**Recommendation**: Add tests for:
1. Spotify API authentication flow
2. Playlist search with valid/invalid queries
3. YouTube video matching logic
4. Error handling for API failures

**Rating**: Needs Tests 📝
